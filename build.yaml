# This file generates the GitHub Actions matrix.
# For simple board + shield combinations, add them to the top level board and
# shield arrays, for more control, add individual board + shield combinations
# to the `include` property. You can also use the `cmake-args` property to
# pass flags to the build command and `artifact-name` to assign a name to
# distinguish build outputs from each other:
#
# board: [ "nice_nano_v2" ]
# shield: [ "corne_left", "corne_right" ]
include:
  - board: nrf52840
    shield: supermini_split_left
    artifact-name: supermini_split_left_firmware
  - board: nrf52840
    shield: supermini_split_right
    artifact-name: supermini_split_right_firmware
  # Example for additional customization
  # - board: nice_nano_v2
  #   shield: corne_left
  #   cmake-args: -DCONFIG_ZMK_USB_LOGGING=y
  #   artifact-name: corne_left_with_logging
